# AliciaJK-Portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio!

https://aliciajk.github.io/AliciaJK-Portfolio/

This website is designed with HTML and CSS. 

There are two main parts of the HTML. There is the main bio and image and the project cards. There is a header and footer with responsive links. 

Top header buttons are bookmarks to the sections of the site. The resume, footer links and project links bring you to a new tab. 

# how it is styled

The first section of the style is the borrowed background style from Muhammed Albarmavi, credits below. Followed by this is the style for the website chronologically from top to bottom. The links to the card images is in the CSS style. 

A style reset sheet is linked at the beginning of the HTML.
